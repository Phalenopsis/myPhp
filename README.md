recode PHP native function in PHP

## an exercise

my PHP teacher likes giving us to recode PHP function
It's a nice exercice but it's boring to do hand tests

## a tool

I wrote a system to compare my function with PHP native function.
If the test is passed, success is print
else the result of the 2 functions is print, withs args who where passed

## a learning

Sometimes, i discover very stranges reactions of PHP native function
(like array_key_exists() where the type of the key searched isn't strict)
